# Platform Adaptability Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure the application runs efficiently on both Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and GPU-enabled environments.

## Core Achievements

### 1. Platform-Adaptive Architecture

- Created a modular architecture that automatically detects the platform and uses the appropriate implementation
- Implemented the `IndexProvider` class to abstract platform-specific details
- Simplified the codebase by removing conditional imports and platform checks from application code

### 2. Apple Silicon Optimizations

- Implemented a custom Byaldi module that forces CPU usage on Apple Silicon
- Used memory-mapped tensors for efficient memory usage
- Applied monkey patches to prevent CUDA initialization errors
- Fixed parameter passing issues in the custom implementation

### 3. GPU Environment Support

- Created a dedicated `Dockerfile.gpu` for GPU environments
- Implemented `docker-compose.gpu.yml` with NVIDIA runtime configuration
- Configured GPU-specific environment variables for optimal performance
- Ensured the standard Byaldi implementation is used on GPU systems

### 4. Documentation and Tools

- Updated documentation to reflect the platform-adaptive architecture
- Created `GPU_SETUP.md` with detailed instructions for GPU environments
- Implemented `check_environment.py` to analyze the system and recommend the appropriate configuration
- Created `restart_containers.sh` to simplify container management
